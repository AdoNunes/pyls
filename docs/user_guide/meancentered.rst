Mean-centered PLS
=================

In contrast to behavioral PLS, mean-centered_PLS doesn't aim to find
relationships between two sets of variables. Instead, it tries to find
relationships between *groupings* in a single set of variables. Indeed, you can
think of it almost like a multivariate t-test or ANOVA (depending on how many
groups you have!).
