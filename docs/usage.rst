User guide
==========

Partial least squares (PLS) is a multivariate statistical technique that aims
to find shared information between two sets of variables. If you're unfamiliar
with PLS and are interested in a thorough (albeit quite technical) treatment,
`Abdi et al., 2013 <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-62703-059-5_23>`_ is a good
resource.

This user guide will go through the basic statistical concepts of and detail
the two types of PLS implemented in the current package
(:ref:`usage_behavioral` and :ref:`usage_meancentered`), demonstrate how to
interpret and use the results of a PLS analysis (:ref:`usage_results`), and
provide some information on the compatibility of this toolbox with the
`Matlab PLS toolbox <https://www.rotman-baycrest.on.ca/index.php?section=84>`_
(:ref:`usage_matlab`).
